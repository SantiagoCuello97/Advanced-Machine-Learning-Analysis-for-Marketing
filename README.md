# Advanced Machine Learning Analysis for Marketing - Cognitive Class Project

## Abstract
This lab developed by [Dr. Yaroslav Vyklyuk](https://author.skills.network/instructors/yaroslav_vyklyuk_2) is dedicated to learning the Advanced Machine Learning methods for analysis of Retail based on 3 years sales data for 45 stores located in different regions - each store contains a number of departments.

## Introduction
One challenge of modeling retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited data. During the holidays and select major events there is an increase in sales, and so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line. Discounts and promotions can also affect sales. The goal of this lab is to predict which departments will be affected and to what extent.

Therefore, the main problems to be solved are the use of advanced methods of machine learning to:

1. Predict the department-wide sales for each store;
2. Model the effects of markdowns on holiday weeks;
3. Provide marketing recommended actions based on the insights drawn, with prioritization placed on largest business impact.

## Prerequisites
Python - advanced level
Scikit-learn - intermediate level
keras - intermediate level
Pandas - basic level
SeaBorn - basic level

## Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Download a DataSet from *.csv files
- Merge DataSets
- Make autocorrelation analisys
- Transform DataSet accordingly Lag shift
- Apply basic and advanced methods of machine learning such a: Linear regression, Back-Propagation and Reccurent Neural Networks
- Calculate accuracy of models
- Make forecasting
- Calculate and analisys sensitivity of models

## Conclusion
This lab was learned how to analyze and forecast store sales.

It was shown how to use autocorrelation analysis to find time lag delays. Studied how to transform a DataSet to take into account time delays in data. It was shown how to use linear models, backpropagation neural networks and recurrent neural networks to predict time series on the example of week sales of the store department.

It was shown how to build combined DataSets containing both lag delays and store activity data. On the basis of neural network, the influence of markdowns in the store on sales both during the holiday and regular weeks was analyzed. Proposed sales strategy for a specific department.
